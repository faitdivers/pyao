\section{Introduction}

In the study of a control algorithm for a high resolution imaging system, a knowledge of the sensor is required.  Although the control algorithm is interested in the wavefront aberrations, the sensor measures only the intensity and information about the wavefront must be derived from there.  The sensor model developed in this project expresses the intensity distribution through the point spread function (PSF). This document will discuss the relationship of the PSF and (1) the Fraunhofer approximation, (2) the effect of using a discrete Fourier transform and (3) the imaging system parameters - including focal length, lens diameter and wavelength.  Further, the results of selecting a non-circular pupil function and the addition of noise to the model is discussed. Once the model for a single lens has been developed, it is extended to a lenslet array to model a Shack-Hartmann sensor.
