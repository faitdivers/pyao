\section{Various Pupil Functions}

The selection of an arbitrary pupil shape and size requires the variation of only the Pupil Function given in Section \ref{sec:FrApprox} Equation \ref{PupilFunction}.  It can be specified discretely, however the discrete sampling should be at least as small as the wavefront sampling.  The result for a square pupil and a round pupil are shown below in Figure \ref{fig:Pupils}.

The intensity distribution for the square pupil shows a similarity to the diffraction pattern for a slit along the x and y axes.  The central peak is a rounded-square with fringes out along the x, y axes and in the diagonals.
